        1. <strong>Internet Connection:</strong> A stable internet connection is required to access Bubbleâ€™s Data API and fetch data from the database. Ensure that your network connection is reliable to avoid interruptions during data retrieval.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        2. <strong>Bubble Data API URL:</strong> You need to have a valid and properly formatted Bubble Data API URL endpoint. This URL is necessary for connecting to your Bubble application's database and fetching the required data.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        3. <strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> The app is designed to work with modern web browsers. Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge for the best experience.

            <li><strong>Things to note when filtering by date:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">If you filter by date, the value will change to a date input, and you need to select the date you want to filter your data by. For the date that you selected, for example, 8/7/2024, its hours, minutes, and seconds will all be 0. Basically, it is the very first start of the day.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">So if you want to filter the data within a specific date range, you need to use "greater than" and "less than" as your constraint types. Basically, you filter by two columns with the same name (e.g., Created Date) to filter the data with a specific date range.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you want to filter data from January 1, 2024, to May 31, 2024, you will first add a column, such as "Created Date." Select "greater than" as the constraint type and input January 1, 2024. Next, add another column, choose "less than" as the constraint type, and input June 1, 2024, instead of May 31, 2024. This is because the time for the date will default to 0, so inputting June 1 ensures that data for May 31 is included. Essentially, inputting the day after your end date covers all data up to and including May 31.</li>
